A Redirect URL module in PrestaShop is a tool that allows administrators to redirect specific URLs to another URL. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as when a product has been discontinued and a similar product is available, when a page has moved to a new URL, or when a website has undergone a redesign and the URLs have changed. The module provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing redirect rules, and it supports both permanent 301 redirects and temporary 302 redirects.
